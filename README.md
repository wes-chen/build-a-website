# build-a-website

This repository holds the syllabus and lesson plans for Mar Vista HS "build a website" course.
This is a work in progress as I am writing this from scratch.

## Syllabus

This is a course that will take place over 12 weeks.

The first two weeks will deal making your own Github account, with Github Desktop, and Github Pages.

The next ten weeks will cover basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and maybe Javascript (TBD).

By the end of the course, you should have a working website that you can proudly show off to your friends (and flex on them).
